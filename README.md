## Logana - Log Analysis Manager / BP - BleepingComputer

Hello everyone! I've been working in this project for few days only, so sorry the mess in the code.
The goal of this "app" is to help malware analysts that volunteer in malware removal forums helping people to clean their computers.

Some volunteers work in many forums and there is a lack of tools to help them to unite all these informations and their tools. With Logana I hope that 
I can help the community uniting all tools and information needed to proceed with a log cleaning. I'm a volunteer in the BleepingComputer forum, certainly this will help myself to help those who seek help in the forum.

Made of what:
* Webpack
* Some NPM modules
* React
* Semantic UI
* Django

### The project is very messy yet, sorry about that. I'm still studying the best way to build it, because there is some new ideas along the developing and I hope that I can unite everything and build complete tool. :)
